🚀 I built **MonM** — a privacy-first messaging PWA where "People say MonM me."

What it does:
• End-to-end encrypted chats, photos & files
• Screenshot protection & copy blocking
• Blockchain-embedded fingerprints on every message & media
• Forward & download only with sender’s permission
• Kill switch — if content is leaked, it becomes unrenderable

Tech & tools:
• **Frontend:** Next.js 14, React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript
• **Backend:** Node.js, Express, WebSocket, SQLite
• **Blockchain:** Polygon (message hashes, file fingerprints, forward traces)
• **Hosting:** Netlify (frontend), Render (backend)
• **APIs:** Ethers.js, JWT, Web Crypto

Install as a PWA on any device. Privacy by design. 🔒
